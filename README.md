Hello! I’m an economist and data scientist with a deep passion for financial inclusion and applied research. Currently, I am a Chevening Scholar at LSE, pursuing a MSc in Applied Social Data Science, and I bring over six years’ experience in causal inference, experimentation, and credit risk analysis, especially in Latin America.
