# Magdaly Santillanez
Hello! I’m an economist and data scientist with a deep passion for financial inclusion and applied research. Currently, I am a Chevening Scholar at LSE, pursuing a MSc in Applied Social Data Science, and I bring over six years’ experience in causal inference, experimentation, and credit risk analysis, especially in Latin America.

My expertise spans machine learning, regression analysis, and programming in Python, R, and SQL. I’m skilled in data visualization (Power BI, Tableau), web scraping, and storytelling to share insights that drive decisions. I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional teams and enjoy mentoring and supporting others’ growth.

I value curiosity, adaptability, and clear communication, and I’m always eager to learn from others’ experiences. As I look forward to returning to Mexico, I am seeking meaningful opportunities in economics, fintech, and related fields. If you’d like to exchange ideas or explore collaboration, I’d love to connect!
